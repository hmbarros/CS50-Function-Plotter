# Math Function Plotter
#### Video Demo:  <https://prezi.com/v/view/tZmUU5TmkK2gOyWWn0Pq/>
#### Description:

My project has 2 files, the "project" and the "test_project". In the "project" i creat 12 python functions.The first three are the "main" function, that organize the code logic and gerate the plots, the "get_function" function, that give the user a choise of which math function he'll study and the "function_select" function, that use the user input to select the math functions.

The following 9 functions are the math functions that will generate the X and Y values for the graph, and they are: 1 - first_degree; 2 - second_degree; 3 - sinusoidal; 4 - polynomial; 5 - cosinusoidal; 6 - exponential; 7 - constant; 8 - logarithmic; 9 - modular.

For each of the functions, the user must choose the constants present in the model, in this way the code will generate only the X data arrays, calculate the Y data array and plot the graph referring to the mathematical function used

The libraries used in the code are 2: Numpy and Matplotlib. The numpy librarie was used to manipulate de datas used in the plots, while matplotlib was used to generate the images. To install the Numpy librarie you need to run te command "pip install Numpy" in the terminal and, at the same time, for the matplotlib you need run "pip install matplotlib" in the terminal.

In the code i import the numpy as np and matplotlib.pyplot as plt, to use the functions more easily and make the code more consise.
